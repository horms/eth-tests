Environment
-----------

Target environment for running tests

Three machines
1. Controller
   - Machine running Linux which controls the test
   - Has ssh access to board
2. Board
   - board to be tested
   - Provides ssh access to board
3. Switch
   - Switch to control the link negotiation parameters of
   - Should be directly connected to the board and thus,
     allowing link negotiation between the switch and the board
     to be tested
   - Tests built against a Cisco SG300-JP-20

Root File System of Board
- I use NFS root
- On some boards it is possible to use local flash
- For tests with minimal dependencies it may be possible to use an initrd


1. Ensure that expect, netperf and python 2.7 is installed on controller

2. Ensure that sshd and netserver are running on board
   - Ideally this should happen automatically on boot
   - netserver is the server-side of netperf

3. Ensure that the controller has password-less access to the board
   This may be achieved using:
   - An ssh key with a pass-phrase in conjunction with the ssh-key agent or;
   - An ssh key with no pass-phrase

4. Ensure that ssh access to the CLI of the switch is available.
   - The tests were tested using access as a user with privilege level 15
   - The tests expect to be prompted for a username and password

5. Manually install board component of tests
   - Data, libraries, programs etc...
   - tests/ltsi-3.10/board/


4. Controller executes test by running controller components locally.
   These connect to the switch and board using ssh as needed.

   e.g.
   ./tests/ltsi-3.10/controller/negotiation.py fast_ether \
      sw0 sw_user sw_pass gi1 \
      armadillo800eva root eth0 /opt/eth-tests/ltsi-3.10/common

   See ./tests/ltsi-3.10/controller/negotiation.py -h for information
   on the parameters to the test

5. Test exists with a value of 0 on success and any other value on error

   Tests may output informational messages to stdout or stderr

   e.g.
   ./tests/ltsi-3.10/controller/negotiation.py ...


   Tests should output errors to stderr
